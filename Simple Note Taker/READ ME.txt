Simple Note Taker is my attempt at making a note taking application using Python 3.11 and PyQt5 (A Qt GUI bind "for" Python).

Thus far, the application has a single file menu with four actions: Clear Note, Save Note, Load Note, and Exit. The separator, of course, doesn not count.

The SimpleNoteTaker class inherits its functionality from QWidget. The widget has one vertical box layout with contains a QTextEdit, a nexted horizantal layout containing the 
color picker, and cler note push bottons. A Save Note, and Load Note button are arranged one on top of each other.

To do:
      1 - Fix the issue of the color reseting once caret is at beginning,
      2 - Organize the code better. Right now, it is a mess.
      3 - Add edit file, and actions.
